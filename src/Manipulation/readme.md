#Friday 24th of May

Style the site, put a form and input
First make sure the php functions are working, last make the button work with at least 1 characterinput
in stead of putting the string manipulation into a big function, i put it first separatly (so I have a view of what it does)
Needed a little help to fix str_pad with strlen because of the syntax I wrote was wrong.
$randomstring -> i didn't want to make a whole function for it, so i found this sub string(string shuffle "string") + conca

#27th of May
trying to fix the  function,
I have put the character i took from the string in front of the string

##Array, associative array and objects

1. Array: An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time,
an ordered map

2. Associative array: Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.
