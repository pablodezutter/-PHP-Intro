#index.php
first try to get my array, and try to switch the img

#index2.+ Lottery.php
Did not make to much layout because I rather would have it working fine. 
Exercise can be made on another way, different visions of exercise by people.
I saw it as a slot machine.


#index2.php fits with Lottery.php

I find it very difficult to get the Lottery HTML together with the php.
I had it working fine but did not get it on the Lottery.php. 
Raf (aka Bruce, thanks Bruce!) said I better put everything in a function on the index2 and we took out the <img = ...<?php ...?>/>
