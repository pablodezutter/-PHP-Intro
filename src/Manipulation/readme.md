#Friday 24th of May

Style the site, put a form and input
First make sure the php functions are working, last make the button work with at least 1 characterinput
in stead of putting the string manipulation into a big function, i put it first separatly (so I have a view of what it does)
Needed a little help to fix str_pad with strlen because of the syntax I wrote was wrong.
$randomstring -> i didn't want to make a whole function for it, so i found this sub string(string shuffle "string") + concat
